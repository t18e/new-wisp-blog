## Some things about me:
* Politics at UCL with a focus on innovation policy, political theory and international political economy (IPE). 
* Currently interested in the implications of digital monism on relationships, consumption psychologies and political ideologies.
* Working on reading way more fiction with the help of [the best recommendation engine](https://en.app/).

## Some things I've worked on:
I enjoy ideating & building for underserved markets, and I've been lucky to work on a few interesting ventures](https://t18e.com/blog/idea-ball) during my time at UCL. Here are a few of my favourites:

* Brade: a plug-and-play accounting tool for salons and other beauty services. We built Brade to make reconciling multi-channel payments, forecasting finances and filing taxes 10x cheaper and 100x easier.
* Pubbler: a writing assistant specifically for Substack writers built on Claude Sonnet to provide tailored writing feedback. We , but it didn't feel right. 
* REN: a wearable ring for individuals struggling with addictions to discreetly seek help via touch sensor & BLE. REN was designed based on Prochaska and DiClementeâ€™s transtheoretical model of behavioral change.
* Soundtrack: a 'song a day' social media platform based on the tried-and-tested streak model by BeReal and Snapchat. I advised on Soundtrack's product and on-campus marketing strategies.
* Banga: a WhatsApp booking agent for Africa's restaurants. During testing, Banga automated the entire process via WhatsApp, from booking to email confirmations, cutting booking time by 80%.
* Almanac: an AMA, Reddit-style forum for student-alumni networking and mentorship. I built this specifically for my alma mater, but it unfortunately didn't materialise. 

It's uncertain why some of these didn't succeed as expected. In some cases, it was simply a matter of [inertia](https://t18e.com/blog/inertia). In other instances, it's quite possible we 'overniched' and were just 1-2 pivots away from getting it right.
